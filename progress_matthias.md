Main Progress:

[ ] User must be able to play with another player directly on the website (Mandatory)
[ ] Local gameplay (Mandatory)
    • Users must be able to participate in a live Pong game against another player directly
    on the website. Both players will use the same keyboard. The Remote players
    module can enhance this functionality with remote players.
    • All players must adhere to the same rules, including having identical paddle speed.
    This requirement also applies when using AI; the AI must exhibit the same speed
    as a regular player.
[ ] add Tournement system (Mandatory)
    • A registration system is required: at the start of a tournament, each player must
    input their alias. The aliases will be reset when a new tournament begins. How-
    ever, this requirement can be modified using the Standard User Management
    module. Note: This does not imply user account creation.
    In the default (mandatory) version, users simply enter an alias manually.
    • A player must be able to play against another, and a tournament system should
    also be available. This tournament will consist of multiple players who can take
    turns playing against each other. You have flexibility in how you implement the
    tournament, but it must clearly display who is playing against whom and the order
    of the play.
    • There must be a matchmaking system: the tournament system should organize
    the matchmaking of the participants, and announce the next match.
[ ] registration system for Tournement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Remote play (Major Module)
    •It should be possible for two players to play remotely. Each player is located on a
    separated computer, accessing the same website and playing the same Pong game.
    Consider network issues, such as unexpected disconnections or lag.
    You must offer the best user experience possible.

[ ] Server Side Rendering (Minor Module)
    In this minor module, the focus is on integrating Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
    to enhance the performance and user experience of your website. Key objectives
    include:
    ◦ Implement SSR to improve the website’s loading speed and overall perfor-
    mance.
    ◦ Ensure that content is pre-rendered on the server and delivered to users’
    browsers for faster initial page loads.
    ◦ Optimize SEO by providing search engines with pre-rendered HTML content.
    ◦ Maintain a consistent user experience while benefiting from the advantages of
    SSR.
    This module aims to boost website performance and SEO by integrating Server-Side
    Rendering for faster page loads and improved user experience.
