	- login part with david

## David
- is a bit less ko
- got connection between frontend and backend
- everything works now
- register works together with backend and database now
- question to ivan: what do you need?
	- like after klicking on register - need any response?
	- -> after register and login there should be a step to move to the landing page
	- -> but should be guarded
	- -> maybe landing should not be public (?)

## thing to think about
- what should be in public?
