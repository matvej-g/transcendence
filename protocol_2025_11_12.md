# Protocol, 12th November 2025

## who is present
- Milena, David, Ivan, Matthias, Mert

## structure today
- how is everyone, what are we working at and whats next?

## david
- ko from work
- working on nginx config to serve frontend - backend at the same time
- nginx is a webserver that serves as a gateway for APIs
- needs frontend container to connect everything (-> Milena)

## Ivan
- did middleware -> typescript logic
- did basic html page with some buttons
- did readme
- further: typescript buttons will call typescript logic which will call php backend
	- add css -> Milena
	- login-button.ts
	- will talk about it Milena - Ivan
- further: link buttons to backend

## Matthias
- game view php file -> game button (opens window and moving paddels)
- rendering is still on client
- next: server side rendering
- david says it would make sense to seperate it from what he did

## Mert
- started 2-factor authentication -> works with email but only for itself
- json web token -> token to client for login
- for now always 2-factor authentication (without disable/enable)

## Milena
- health issues
- did tutorials and exercises about css and tailwind css
- thought about rough structure of the website
- trying to get overview
- next: frontend container
- continue from where Ivan started (talk about it Ivan - Milena)

## rules for merging to main
- instead of git pull / git merge / git push:
	- push to your branch, on branch page will be green button with command
	- create pull / merge request
	- on main page is pull request
	- send screenshot so someone can review it
	- in doubt -> ask Ivan

## new eval date 24.01.?
- Milena asks if we could postpone eval date to weekend of 24.01.2026
- what do team mates think about it?
	- everyone is ok with it
- Ivan would have to do 3 weeks blackhole salvation program
	- cannot tell yet, but probably yes
	- will aim do at least 4 (97% sure it will work) or even 6 weeks (85%)

## Should we use name headers in files? - yes
- would be helpfull to know who wrote the code
- 42-header? problem -> git merging with date conflict
- solution: just write name in first line as a comment
	- person that creates the file first line
	- if someone else edits, comment after or before edited part

## do many commits!

## Next meeting: Wednesday 19th november 19:00h
